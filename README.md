# eq2statter

This [Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT)](http://advancedcombattracker.com/) plugin
will display a graph of combat stats during parsed encounters.

## Setup
1. Download ACT
2. Download the plugin
 [statter.dll](https://github.com/walkerjam/eq2statter/blob/master/bin/Release/Statter.dll?raw=true)
 to a location on your hard drive
3. Setup ACT as you would normally
4. Open ACT and select the __Plugins__ tab
5. Click __Browse...__, and select the location where you saved the plugin
6. Click __Add/Enable Plugin__
7. Click the new __Statter__ tab to configure the plugin
8. Add a couple of stats to start (eg. Fervor, Potency) by clicking the __+__
button and selecting the desired stat
  * Optionally select the colour that will be used to display the stat in the
  encounter graph
9. Take a moment to read the __Instructions__ on this tab, they'll explain a few
of the less obvious features of the plugin

## Usage
1. Create a macro in the EQ2 client that includes the command
__/do_file_commands statter.txt__
  * Every time you run this macro, your selected stats will be dumped to the log
  and parsed -- so use this macro as often as you would like to parse your stats
  * Add the macro step to a temp buff or other frequently used spell to track
  your stats without having to click the macro manually.
2. You should now be able to right-click on an encounter in ACT, and select
__View Encounter Stats__ at the bottom of the menu
3. This will open a window where you will see the stats that you selected in the
initial setup
4. Click on a stat to see it graphed over the duration of the encounter
  * If you select more than one stat, they will be overlayed on the same graph
  (albeit using the same scale...)
4. If you mouse-over the graph, it will show you the time and stat value at the
mouse's position
5. The grey area on the graph (only applicable when a single stat is shown)
represents the average over the duration of the encounter

## Building
This project was created using [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx).
The project user file is configured to launch ACT during debug -- this path may
be different on your machine.

The entry point for the plugin is in __StatterPlugin.cs__, and the main UI
is __StatterUI.cs__.

The plugin saves its settings in the following location:
__<ACT_Dir>\\Config\\Statter.config.xml__.

If you build and add the Debug version of the plugin, you will notice some extra
info on the plugin settings tab, as well as logging to your desktop folder.
